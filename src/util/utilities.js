    quote: `I must compliment Amorétalla on the gowns we received. They are obviously stunning, but as a boutique manager, I cannot get over how well they are designed. Even the hang straps are well thought out. And don't get me started on how nicely the convertible skirts and trains go on and come off! It's an absolute privilege to work with these garments!!!! I'm having SO MUCH FUN!!!! Thank you!!!!`,
